# Deploy a Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website on AWS. First, I created an S3 bucket, set it up for website hosting, and added IAM policies for security. Then, I uploaded the website files and improved the speed using CloudFront. Finally, I opened the website in a browser using the S3 endpoint.
